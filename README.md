Wordpress-Cron-Manager
======================

This plugin will add an option to list, delete and restore cronjobs in WP Cron. It’s loosely based on Simon Wheatley’s http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cron-view/ and it’s compatible up to version 3.4 (current beta). It will create a backup of your crons when you install it, in order to be able to restore anything that may get broken.

Future releases may include the capability of creating new cronjobs.
